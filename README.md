# ðŸ‘¾ About Me

I am `carnifex17`, pizza fan, cybersecurity student, ethical hacker, and just a good guy. I am active on platforms like <mark style="color:green;">**HackTheBox**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**TryHackMe**</mark> and member of <mark style="color:purple;">**purplestorm**</mark> team. Here you could find my notes, interesting and useful things and also here would be my portfolio later
