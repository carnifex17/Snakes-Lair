# IMAP / POP3

**With the help of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), access to emails from a mail server is possible. Unlike the Post Office Protocol (POP3), IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures.** Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server. The protocol is client-server-based and allows synchronization of a local email client with the mailbox on the server, providing a kind of network file system for emails, allowing problem-free synchronization across several independent clients. POP3, on the other hand, does not have the same functionality as IMAP, and it only provides listing, retrieving, and deleting emails as functions at the email server. Therefore, protocols such as IMAP must be used for additional functionalities such as hierarchical mailboxes directly at the mail server, access to multiple mailboxes during a session, and preselection of emails. Clients access these structures online and can create local copies. Emails remain on the server until they are deleted. It is also possible for several users to access the email server simultaneously. Without an active connection to the server, managing emails is impossible. However, some clients offer an offline mode with a local copy of the mailbox. The client synchronizes all offline local changes when a connection is reestablished. The client establishes the connection to the server via port 143.

### Dangerous Settings

* `auth_debug` - Enables all authentication debug logging.
* `auth_debug_passwords` - This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.
* `auth_verbose` - Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.
* `auth_verbose_passwords` - Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.
* `auth_anonymous_username` - This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.

### Tips2Hack

1. By default, ports `110`, `143`, `993`, and `995` are used for IMAP and POP3
2. Nmap basic footprinting

```bash
sudo nmap 13.13.13.13 -sV -p110,143,993,995 -sC
```

3. IMAP Curl List mailboxes

```bash
curl -k 'imaps://13.13.13.13' --user user:p4ssw0rd
```

4. OpenSSL - TLS Encypted Interaction POP3
