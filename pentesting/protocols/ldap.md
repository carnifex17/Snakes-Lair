# LDAP

**Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a protocol that helps users find data about organizations, persons, and more.** LDAP has two main goals: to store data in the LDAP directory and authenticate users to access the directory. It also provides the communication language that applications require to send and receive information from directory services. A directory service provides access to _where_ information on organizations, individuals, and other data is located within a network.

### Basic LDAP Components

* `DIT` - Directory Information tree
* `DN` - Distinguished name, which contains a path through the DIT for LDAP to navigate (ex. cn=Susan, ou=users, o=Company)
* `dc` - **Domain Access Component** - uses DNS mapping to locate Internet domain names and translate them into Ip address. Most users don’t know the domain name and/or IP address of the individual they’re searching for. In this case, LDAP uses the Distinguished Name (DN) assigned to the user as a path to quickly navigate through the DIT and find the search result.
* `o` - o subclass is one of the most general subclasses listed in the DN, and it is usually where LDAP starts when it runs a search
* `ou` - **Organizational Unit**. Subclass of o. Mostly seen as ou=users or/and ou=group, with each containing a list of user accounts or groups.
* `cn` - Common Name. Used to identify the name of a group or user account.
