# RSYNC

<mark style="color:red;">**Rsync**</mark> is a fast and efficient <mark style="color:purple;">**tool for locally and remotely copying files**</mark>. **Rsync** reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring.
