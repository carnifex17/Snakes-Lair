# NFS

**Network File System (NFS) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB.** Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. The `/etc/exports` file contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients.

### Dangerous Settings

* `rw` - Read and write permissions.
* `insecure` - Ports above 1024 will be used.
* `nohide` - If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.
* `no_root_squash` - All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.

### Tips2Hack

1. Basic nmap footprinting

```bash
sudo nmap --script nfs* 13.13.13.13 -sV -p111,2049
```

2. Show available NFS shares

```bash
showmount -e 13.13.13.13
```

3. Mounting & Unmounting NFS shares

```bash
> mkdir target-NFS
> sudo mount -t nfs 13.13.13.13:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
> sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
