# WinRM

**The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line.** WinRM uses the **Simple Object Access Protocol (`SOAP`)** to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. WinRM relies on TCP ports `5985` and `5986` for communication, with the last port 5986 using HTTPS. Services like remote sessions using PowerShell and event log merging require WinRM.
