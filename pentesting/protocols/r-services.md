# R-Services

<mark style="color:red;">**R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP.**</mark> Much like telnet, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing **man-in-the-middle (`MITM`) attacks. R**-Services mostly using ports `512, 513, 514` and only accessible via suite of programs known as `r-commands`. The R-commands suite contains:

* rcp (`remote copy`)
* rexec (`remote execution`)
* rlogin (`remote login`)
* rsh (`remote shell`)
* rstat
* ruptime
* rwho (`remote who`)

### Quick Overview

| Command  | Service Daemon | Port | Transport Protocol | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | -------------- | ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rcp`    | `rshd`         | 514  | TCP                | Copy a file from the local system to remote (or vice versa). Works like `cp` but don't provide warning for overwriting files.                     |
| `rsh`    | `rshd`         | 514  | TCP                | Opens a shell on remote machine without login. Relies upon trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts/equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation           |
| `rexec`  | `rexecd`       | 512  | TCP                | Enables to run shell command on remote machine. Requires authentification with `username:password` or with `/etc/hosts/equiv` and `.rhosts` files |
| `rlogin` | `rlogind`      | 513  | TCP                | Enables a user log in to a remote host over the network. Unix-only. Use `/etc/hosts/equiv` and `.rhosts` files to authentification                |

### Tips2Hack

1. Logging in Using Rlogin

```bash
rlogin 13.13.13.13 -l username
```

2. Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho

```bash
rwho
```

3. Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers

```bash
rusers -al 13.13.13.13
```
