# FTP

#### TFTP

One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions is vsFTPd. The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found in `/etc/vsftpd.conf`. Users, for which access to FTP server is forbidden could be found at /etc/ftpusers file

#### Dangerous Config Settings

* `anonymous_enable=YES` - Allowing anonymous login?
* `anon_upload_enable=YES` - Allowing anonymous to upload files?
* `anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES` - Allowing anonymous to create new directories?
* `no_anon_password=YES` - Do not ask anonymous for password?
* `anon_root=/home/username/ftp` - Directory for anonymous.
* `write_enable=YES` - Allow the usage of FTP commands

#### Tips2Hack

1. Try to use anonymous login, config allows that, you could lurk for some juicy info. For this just use `anonymous` as login name, and left password empty.
2. If config allows, you could lurk even faster through directories with recursive listing `ls -R`
3. To download a file you need to use `get` command and to upload you need `put` and also you could use `status` to get more info about server and FTP state
4. To download **all** files you need to use

```bash
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```

5. Check all available nmap ftp scripts:

```bash
find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts
```
