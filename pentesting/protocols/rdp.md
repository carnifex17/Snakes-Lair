# RDP

**The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol developed by Microsoft for remote access to a computer running the Windows operating system.** This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. Works at `Application Layer` of TCP/IP model, typically using `TCP port 3389`. If Network Address Translation (NAT) is used on the route between client and server, as is often the case with Internet connections, the remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. It uses `TLS/SSL`
