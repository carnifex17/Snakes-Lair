# Recon

### <mark style="color:green;">Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.</mark>

***

**To do proper reconnaissance we should use three principles:**

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.**</mark>
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.**</mark>
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.**</mark>

### Methodology

This methodology of footprinting is nested in 6 layers and represents, metaphorically speaking, boundaries that we try to pass with the enumeration process. The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

* Infrastructure-based enumeration
* Host-based enumeration
* OS-based enumeration  So basically our hacking process should look like this (squares is our gaps in security):  Let's look more about our goals in each layer of this labyrinth:

* Layer 1: **Internet Presence** <mark style="color:blue;">`The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested.`</mark>
* Layer 2: **Gateway** <mark style="color:blue;">`The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.`</mark>
* Layer 3: **Accessible Services** <mark style="color:blue;">`This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.`</mark>
* Layer 4: **Processes** <mark style="color:blue;">`The goal here is to understand these factors and identify the dependencies between them.`</mark>
* Layer 5: **Privileges** <mark style="color:blue;">`It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges.`</mark>
* Layer 6: **OS Setup** <mark style="color:blue;">`The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.`</mark>
