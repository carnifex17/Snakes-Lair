# Nmap

## About

Nmap is a complex port-scanning tool which is very often used by security specialists. It's more complex that ncat so in some ways sysadmins or programmers could use them to check hosts and port available.

And it's a lot more complex than other tool ncat, which we can use for port-scanning purposes too
